Welcome to the Karith documentation website.

Karith is an arithmetic parser for Kotlin. It takes arithmetic expressions as a String and calculates them into a
result. It can also handle expressions that contains variables.

It is designed to be easy to use and highly configurable. It comes with builtin functions, operators and constants but
can be extended with custom elements.

This library is built on Kotlin Multiplatform. It does not require any external dependencies.
